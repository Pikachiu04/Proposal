# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

The likely title of the project would be, Rosen Clicker. 


## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Essentiaily cookie clicker, but instead of a cookie it's Mr. Rosen.


## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My software would have a picture of Mr. Rosen's face thats clickable and the more you click on Rosen's face the higher your score will be. The game would track the player's score for how many times Rosen's face is clicked. Like the original cookie clicker, Rosen Clicker would also be a single player game.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

I don't plan on combining the final project with another course's final project.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

I plan to collaborate with 1 other classmate for the final project. His name is Jordan Davies and his email is tus05687@temple.edu. The name of his TA is Daniel Blitshtein.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome for my final project would be a working clicker game that is able to track the score of the player.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome for my final project would be a working clicker game that is able to track the score of the player as well as implementing a sound effect every time Rosen is clicked.  

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome of the final project would be a working clicker game that tracks the score of the player, plays a sound every time Rosen is clicked and a few upgrades that can multiply the player's score per click. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Some new skills I would have to acquire is how to implement my own sound effects in a program and also a way of adding a tab for the upgrades of the clicker game. I would need to research how to start a cookie clicker game and then work on my own variation of that. Since I'm working with another classmate, we would both be responsible for researching as well as coding, but we would help each other out incase there's a problem with the code, etc... I'm not sure yet but one of us would be resposible for getting the sound effects and if enough time is availible, the other would be responsible for the score muliplier if possible.
